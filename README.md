# readathon

This is code that I wrote.  It's a personal project, first started in (I think) the 2015-2016 academic year, to run
my kids' elementary school Read-A-Thon minute tracker, because there really aren't any good ones out there.  I'm
putting this on GitHub now because:

   a) It's my last year I'll be doing it for the school, and other parents will (I hope) be taking it over
   b) Other schools may find it useful, if they come across this project.

You are welcome to use this project, and eventually I'll get useful information up in this README.  Please do not
misrepresent who wrote the core code, though.
